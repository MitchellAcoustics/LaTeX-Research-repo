# Research-repo

A template repo for writing and coding a research paper using LaTeX, Python, and R. Some more developed and different takes on this are:

## .gitignore

This template includes a .gitignore generated by [gitignore.io](https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore). By default, I have included Python, R, JupyterNotebooks, LaTeX, vscode, and Windows since those are the tools I use for writing papers and doing research. If you are on a different OS or use different tools, **I recommend generating your own gitignore and making the update your first commit**. Having this keeps the git history much cleaner, but it's best if it is done right at the start.

## README's

By default, each of the subdirectories has a README.md which explains the intended use and setup for that directory. It also ensures these directories show up in GitHub. A good use may be to use the READMEs as a lab notebook which documents what you are doing throughout your analysis and writing, each day that you work within that subdirectory.

The folder structures are based on the guidance given in [Noble WS (2009) A Quick Guide to Organizing Computational Biology Projects. PLOS Computational Biology 5(7): e1000424.](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000424) and the [Reproducible Science repository templated](https://github.com/Reproducible-Science-Curriculum/rr-init). However, I have renamed some of the folders and differentiated between `notebooks` and `results` as most of my development work happens within Jupyter and Rmd notebooks. I also hate the label `bin` (binaries) for important stuff since I live in England and the bin is where you throw shit away. So, I renamed it `scripts`. Other than that, the principles should be the same as in Nobel (2009).
