# LaTeX-Research-repo
A template repo for writing and coding a research paper using LaTeX, Python, and R

## .gitignore
This template includes a .gitignore generated by [gitignore.io](https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore). By default, I have included Python, R, JupyterNotebooks, vscode, and Windows since those are the tools I use for writing papers and doing research. If you are on a different OS or use different tools, **I recommend generating your own gitignore and making the update your first commit**. Having this keeps the git history much cleaner, but it's best if it is done right at the start.
