# drafts

Directory for containing various drafts of whatever paper you're working on. These different drafts may be for revisions when under review, or for applying new formatting for a new journal, etc.

In the existing `draft1` directory, I've included a general manuscript template from <https://github.com/paulgribble/LaTeX>. I find this useful to start with, but it should be replaced with the LaTeX template from the journal you're submitting to.
