# notebooks

This is where the majority of my work happens. Like the data directory, I suggest creating a separate folder for each day, formatted as 2021-01-20. When updating a notebook over multiple days, I end up copying it into the new day's folder, but this can get a bit messy, so another strategy might make more sense. 

When in active development, I tend to output figures, knitted html notebooks, etc into the same folder where the notebook lives. Once I've decided on final versions of figures, etc. these then get outputted to the `results` directory to be pulled into the draft from there.
