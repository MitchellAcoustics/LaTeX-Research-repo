# data

Directory for storing data. Within this directory, I recommend having a separate folder for each day, labelled by the ISO date format (e.g. 2021-01-20). New data generated or compiled on that day should go in that folder. This makes it very clear and obvious exactly which set of data you are working with, when it shows up in your code.
